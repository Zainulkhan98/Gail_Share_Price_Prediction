# Project Title: GAIL Share Price Prediction

The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and finally, model building using XGBoost Regressor.
GAIL -- Gas Authority Of India Limited


### Prerequisites

The project is developed using Python. The following libraries are used:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- seaborn
- sklearn
- xgboost
- joblib

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries. You can use pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn sklearn xgboost joblib
   ```

## Running the tests

 The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and then used to train an XGBoost Regressor model. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R2 Score.
 The scores aren't Good, as to improve further we need very large amount of data --  few more feature engineering steps might improve the model a little bit, but the improvement wouldn't be significant enough.
